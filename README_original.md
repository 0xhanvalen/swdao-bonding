# SW Capital
A Raid Guild project.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create Eth App](https://github.com/paulrberg/create-eth-app).

### Development
Copy `.env.sample` to `.env.test` for dev or `.env.production` for deployment
- Update env values

To be able to develop against auto-rebuilding servers, open 3 terminals and run each of these in a separate one

```
cd packages/backend
yarn start
```

```
cd packages/react-app
yarn start
```

```
yarn startproxy
```

Now you can navigate to [http://localhost:3030] and hit the auto-reloading dev servers.  The proxy will crash if its upstream servers crash, so just start it again.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn clean`
Recursively cleans all build directories.

#### `yarn dist`

Runs the builds for backend and UI packages and copies the result to one tree at "build"

#### `yarn react-app:start`

Runs the React app in development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will automatically reload if you make changes to the code.<br>
You will see the build errors and lint warnings in the console.

#### `yarn react-app:test`

Runs the React test watcher in an interactive mode.<br>
By default, runs tests related to files changed since the last commit.

[Read more about testing React.](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests)

#### `yarn react-app:build`

Builds the React app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the React documentation on [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

#### `yarn react-app:eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `react-app:eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` the React app at any time. This command will
remove the single build dependency from your React package.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right
into the `react-app` package so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `react-app:eject` will still work,
but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `react-app:eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

### Subgraph

The Graph is a tool for for indexing events emitted on the Ethereum blockchain. It provides you with an easy-to-use GraphQL API. <br/>

To learn more, check out the [The Graph documentation](https://thegraph.com/docs).

#### `yarn subgraph:codegen`

Generates AssemblyScript types for smart contract ABIs and the subgraph schema.

#### `yarn subgraph:build`

Compiles the subgraph to WebAssembly.

#### `yarn subgraph:auth`

Before deploying your subgraph, you need to sign up on the
[Graph Explorer](https://thegraph.com/explorer/). There, you will be given an access token. Drop it in the command
below:

```sh
GRAPH_ACCESS_TOKEN=your-access-token-here yarn subgraph:auth
```

#### `yarn subgraph:deploy`

Deploys the subgraph to the official Graph Node.<br/>

Replace `paulrberg/create-eth-app` in the package.json script with your subgraph's name.

## Gcloud Deployment
- Build with `yarn dist` or `GENERATE_SOURCEMAP=false yarn dist` to disable source maps
- Run `gcloud app deploy` to deploy to prod or `gcloud app deploy app.stage.yaml` to deploy to stage
